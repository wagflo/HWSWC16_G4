HW/SW Codesign - build environment
----------------------------------

This is the template project of the HW/SW build environment. It should contain 
the following files and directories.

template
  |- quartus
     |- Makefile
     |- .qpf .qsf                 Quartus project files
     |- .qsys                     Qsys system

     |- bsp                       the automatically created BSP
     |- build                     object/ELF file(s) of your project

  |- Makefile                     master Makefile
  |- README

The hardware project is located in the ./quartus directory. The makefile in this
directory provides the following targets:

make              runs Quartus synthesis (this includes the Qsys system 
                  generation) 
make download     downloads the SOF file to the board
make quartus_gui  starts the Quartus GUI and loads the Quartus project
make qsys_gui     starts the Qsys GUI and loads the Qsys project
make clean        deletes all files, which are generated during the build
                  process. REMEMBER to clean your project before submission!!

Note that you can also start the synthesis and download process using the 
Quartus GUI.

The VHDL code of your submission MUST be placed in the ./vhdl directory. 


The software project is located in the ./software directory. The makefile in 
this folder builds the BSP- and application project and provides the 
following targets:

make            creates BSP and application makefile (if necessary) and creates 
                the ELF file. No download is performed.
make download   downloads the ELF file to the Nios II processor
make term       starts the nios2-terminal (JTAG UART) and connects to the Nios II
                processor
make edit_bsp   opens the BSP settings GUI editor (for settings.bsp)
make run        builds and downloads ELF file and starts nios2-terminal 
                (JTAG UART)
make clean      deletes all files, which are generated during the build
                process. REMEMBER to clean your project before submission!!

All your C source/header files MUST be placed in the ./software/src directory.

IMPORTANT:
You have to run "make" in the software folder from the nios2_command_shell, 
otherwise an error will be raised. To execute the nios2_command_shell run 
/path/to/altera_dir/nios2eds/nios2_command_shell.sh.
To find the path to the nios2_command_shell you can run the command 
"which quartus". This should give you "/path/to/altera_dir/quartus/bin/quartus"


The master makefile starts the whole build process. This includes the Quartus
synthesis and download of the SOF file to the board as well as the software 
build and download of the ELF file to the Nios II processor. When successful the 
nios2-terminal is started. 
We will ONLY use this makefile when we check your submission. This means that a
simple make in the project directory must successfully run the aforementioned 
process. So keep in mind that if you change the build environment or use the
Eclipse IDE, this "feature" must still be functioning! If you are working on 
your own computer make sure that the build works on the TI lab computers! 
However, during the implementation process of your solution you are of free to 
use the graphical interface of Quartus/Qsys as well as Eclipse for software 
development (this can especially be useful if you what to use the debugger).
